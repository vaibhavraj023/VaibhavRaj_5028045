# ModelViewController Pattern Example 10

1. Model - Represents the data and provides methods to access and modify this data.
2. View - Represents how the data should be displayed to the user.
3. Controller - Acts as an intermediary between Model and View. Handles user input updates the model accordingly and updates view to reflect changes in the model.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
